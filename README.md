**This branch contains Python SDK for IBM Db2 Event Store version v2.0.1.4** <br>

The `python.tar` file is identical for Event Store 2.0.1.2.

Steps for using the DB2 Event Store python library

1. Download the `python.tar` file
2. Run `tar -xvf python.tar` to extract the file
3. Add the directory to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable by running this command but enter the correct value of `<path to eventstore\>` below
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:\<path to eventstore\>"
```
